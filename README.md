[Read the project build journal](journal.md) for detailed progress updates and technical notes.
Edit: Please note price has changed since input on the form
## Description
This is a custom-built handheld game console powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5. The project features a custom-designed PCB and 3D-printed case, creating a portable gaming device capable of running retro games and modern indie titles.

## Why I Made This
I wanted to create a unique handheld gaming experience by combining the power of the Raspberry Pi CM5 with custom hardware design. This project allows for complete control over the form factor, button layout, and overall user experience.
